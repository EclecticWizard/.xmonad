My personal XMonad Config

Mostly just the default settings but with the main layout flipped so that the right-hand window is the largest. 
This has currently replaced KWin in my KDE setup so things like the bar are handled by KDE and haven't been configured here.

Screen locking is handled by x-screensaver, the script that is called when pressing `Meta-l` is just a call to xscreensaver.
